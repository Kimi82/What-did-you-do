What Did You Do in last 30 minutes?
## Header 2
I had a big problem with procrastination. So i had idea to solve it by program.
It's very simple program, it ask even 30 minutes what did you do and write it to txt file.
I know it's very simple and maybe bad, but it's my first contact with Python and the most important think: it's work! It helped me a lot.
